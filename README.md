# Data-Science-Kaggle-Learn
Python
Hello, Python
A quick introduction to Python syntax, variable assignment, and numbers

Functions and Getting Help
Calling functions and defining our own, and using Python's builtin documentation

Booleans and Conditionals
Using booleans for branching logic

Lists and Tuples
Lists and the things you can do with them. Includes indexing, slicing and mutating

Loops and List Comprehensions
For and while loops, and a much-loved Python feature: list comprehensions

Strings and Dictionaries
Working with strings and dictionaries, two fundamental Python data types

Working with External Libraries
Imports, operator overloading, and survival tips for venturing into the world of external libraries

Intro to Machine Learning
How Models Work
The first step if you're new to machine learning

Basic Data Exploration
Load and understand your data

Your First Machine Learning Model
Building your first model. Hurray!

Model Validation
Measure the performance of your model ? so you can test and compare alternatives

Underfitting and Overfitting
Fine-tune your model for better performance.

Random Forests
Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.

Exercise: Machine Learning Competitions
Enter the world of machine learning competitions to keep improving and see your progress

Missing Values
Missing values happen. Be prepared for this common challenge in real datasets.

Categorical Variables
There's a lot of non-numeric data out there. Here's how to use it for machine learning

Pipelines
A critical skill for deploying (and even testing) complex models with pre-processing

Cross-Validation
A better way to test your models

XGBoost
The most accurate modeling technique for structured data

Data Leakage
Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle ways

Data Visualization
Hello, Seaborn
Your first introduction to coding for data visualization

Line Charts
Visualize trends over time

Bar Charts and Heatmaps
Use color or length to compare categories in a dataset

Scatter Plots
Leverage the coordinate plane to explore relationships between variables

Distributions
Create histograms and density plots

Choosing Plot Types and Custom Styles
Customize your charts and make them look snazzy

Final Project
Practice for real-world application

Exercise: Creating, Reading and Writing
You can't work with data if you can't read it. Get started here.

Exercise: Indexing, Selecting & Assigning
Pro data scientists do this dozens of times a day. You can, too!

Exercise: Summary Functions and Maps
Extract insights from your data.

Exercise: Grouping and Sorting
Scale up your level of insight. The more complex the dataset, the more this matters
